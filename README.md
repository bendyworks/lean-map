# Lean Hash Array Mapped Trie (Lean Map)

A ClojureScript implementation of Lean Hash Array Mapped Tries. See [reference][lmp].

This is __NOT__ ready for production use right now

### Technical Terms

- HAMT is Hash Array Mapped Trie

### Primary Goals

- See if Lean Hash Array Mapped Tries performs better then the current HAMT implementation in terms of code size, memory usage, or operation speed
- Have a Property Test Suite that tests the current HAMT implementation and can be used to test the Lean HAMT
- Have an benchmark suite testing maps of sizes (100, 10000, and 100000) for `hash`, `assoc`, `dissoc`, `assoc!`, and `dissoc!` operations
- Be a nearly drop in replacement for the current HAMT implementation

### Secondary Goals

- Be a reference implementation of how to implement a Lean HAMT
- Have detailed documentation about how the Lean HAMT differs from the current HAMT implementation

### Current Status

All standard ClojureScript map functionality (`assoc`, `dissoc`, `get`, `seq`, `reduce-kv`, `persistent!`, and `transient`) have been implemented and have passed the eyeball test. The next step is to run generative tests and fix any bugs those tests find.

### Main Ideas of the Paper

#### Consolidation of key values pairs and HAMT nodes

The primary idea behind the paper is changing the current HAMT node implementation from this

`[key1, value1, null, <HAMT Node 1>, key2, value2, key3, value3, null, <HAMTNode 2>] `

to this

`[key1, value1, key2, value2, key3, value3, <HAMT Node 1>, <HAMT Node 2>]`

consolidating the key value pairs and HAMT nodes instead of having them interspersed.

This leads to memory savings from not having to have a marker `null` in front of HAMT node.

#### Compaction on delete

The secondary idea is to have delete always return the most compact HAMT. For example deleting D from this HAMT

`[A, <HAMT Node 1>] -> [<HAMT Node 2>, D] -> [B, C]`

returns this HAMT

`[A, <HAMT Node 1>] -> [<HAMT Node 2>] -> [B, C]`

that has an unnecessary HAMT node (HAMT Node 2). Ideally the delete operation should return

`[A, <HAMT Node 1>] -> [B, C]`

removing the superfluous HAMT node

According to the [paper][lmp] this leads to an 80 to 100 percent speedup for iteration and equality checks and comparable to better performance on insertion, deletion, and lookup.
